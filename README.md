 Improve Code Quality: Coding standards ensure that code is written consistently, readably, and maintainable manner. This makes it easier for developers to understand and work with the code, leading to higher-quality software.
 Increase Efficiency: By following coding standards, developers can save time by avoiding common mistakes and implementing proven solutions.
 Facilitate Collaboration: It creates a common language that all developers can understand and allows teams to collaborate, share code, and communicate effectively.
 Ensure Compatibility: It ensures that code is compatible with different platforms, browsers, and OS-device combinations.
 Reduce Maintenance Costs: By following established standards, developers can avoid introducing new bugs and make changes to code more quickly and easily.

1. Indentation - spaces, new line
2. UseCamel - codeSpace cameCase 
3. Readable name in variable, object, class, function e.g. newAccount, forgetPass
4. Read other giant organization code to follow their code in real life
5. Follow the programming language naming and see other code and make that in your code
6. Do not repeat - Make abstracting code into functions, reuse that code and make development more efficient
Code is for the compiler, while comments are for coders.
7. use comment in your code

Variable naming conventions
Class and function naming conventions
Clear and concise comments
Indentations
Portability
Reusability and scalability
Testing
