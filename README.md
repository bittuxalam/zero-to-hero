 Improve Code Quality: Coding standards ensure that code is written consistently, readably, and maintainable manner. This makes it easier for developers to understand and work with the code, leading to higher-quality software.
 Increase Efficiency: By following coding standards, developers can save time by avoiding common mistakes and implementing proven solutions.
 Facilitate Collaboration: It creates a common language that all developers can understand and allows teams to collaborate, share code, and communicate effectively.
 Ensure Compatibility: It ensures that code is compatible with different platforms, browsers, and OS-device combinations.
 Reduce Maintenance Costs: By following established standards, developers can avoid introducing new bugs and make changes to code more quickly and easily.

1. Indentation - spaces, new line
2. UseCamel - codeSpace cameCase 
3. Readable name in variable, object, class, function e.g. newAccount, forgetPass
4. Read other giant organization code to follow their code in real life
5. Follow the programming language naming and see other code and make that in your code
6. Do not repeat - Make abstracting code into functions, reuse that code and make development more efficient
Code is for the compiler, while comments are for coders.
7. use comment in your code

Variable naming conventions
Class and function naming conventions
Clear and concise comments
Indentations
Portability
Reusability and scalability
Testing

There are many best practices to follow when coding, but some of the most important ones focus on readability, maintainability, and efficiency. Here are a few key areas to consider:

Readability:  Your code should be easy for you and others to understand, even if you come back to it after a long time. This involves using clear and concise variable and function names, adding comments to explain complex logic, and formatting your code consistently with proper indentation and spacing.

Maintainability:  Code that is well-maintained is easy to modify and update as requirements change. This means writing modular code that can be easily reused, avoiding overly complex logic, and using proper error handling to prevent crashes.

Efficiency: While not always the top priority, efficient code uses computing resources effectively. This can involve optimizing algorithms, avoiding unnecessary calculations, and choosing appropriate data structures for your tasks.

Here are some additional tips for best practices:

Follow coding standards and conventions: Many programming languages have established coding standards that define things like naming conventions, formatting, and indentation. Following these standards helps to ensure consistency and readability within your codebase.
Use comments effectively: Comments are lines of text that are ignored by the computer but provide information to human readers. Use comments to explain complex logic, document assumptions, and track changes made to the code.
Test your code thoroughly: Writing good unit tests is essential for ensuring that your code functions as expected. Unit tests allow you to isolate individual parts of your code and verify their behavior.
Practice good coding habits: There are many good habits that will improve your coding skills over time. These include things like using version control to track changes to your code, refactoring code to improve its structure, and constantly learning new things.
By following these best practices, you can write code that is not only functional but also maintainable, readable, and efficient. There are many resources available online and in libraries to help you learn more about coding best practices for specific programming languages.
